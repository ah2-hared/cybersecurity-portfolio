Home SIEM Lab + GRC Mapping 

This project demonstrates how to build a basic home lab for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using Splunk, simulate realistic attacks, detect them, and tie each detection to security policies and compliance frameworks such as ISO 27001 and NIST CSF

Goal: Combine hands-on SOC experience with governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) skills - showing how technical detections map directly to business-level controls 

Skills Demonstrated  
- SIEM deployment & configuration (Splunk free)
- Window logging with Sysmon
- Detection engineering using SPL (search Processing Language)
- Simulated attacks: brute-force, PowerShell abuse, USB insertion, EICAR malware
- Custom dashboard and alerting
- GRC framework mapping (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK)

Lab Setup & Installation
- This lab was deployed on a local window 10 VM using VirtualBox, with Splunk and Sysmon installed.
